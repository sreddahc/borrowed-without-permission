# Borrowed Without Permission

## Idea

2d pokemon style game where you have to get in and out of various locations collecting items. The catch, you have to ensure that the items you collect are adequately weighted or similar enough in appearance to ensure that they do not get detected before you have gotten away.

## Goal

Better understanding of C and C++. Therefore the project will be created mostly in SDL... although I am open to using GoDot for a rewriting in order to learn GoDot.

## Game design
